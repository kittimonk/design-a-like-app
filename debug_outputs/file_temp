Subject: ECM Migration – Meeting Summary, Decisions, and Next Steps

Dear Leadership Team,

Please find below the summary and key outcomes from the ECM migration planning meeting (Frabola → new Azure subscription 3042).

📋 Summary

The team reviewed and finalized the end-to-end migration approach for the ECM application (front-end, Azure SQL, Synapse, and ADLS).
The move is internally driven to exit the Frabola environment due to capacity constraints and will enable deployment of ECM Version 2 in the new subscription while maintaining zero disruption for itte investigators.

✅ Finalized Decisions

Migration Method: Use the Enterprise Data Delivery Pipeline (EDP) for both ECM SQL and Synapse SQL Pool migrations.

Responsibility: The ARE and DAS teams will own the EDP execution with support from DB Engineering (Jack, Jason, Sanjay, Emily).

Application Deployment: itte will install ECM v2 in the new environment and perform validation testing with ARE + DAS.

Cut-Over Plan:

One-time cut-over after full testing and data parity validation.

Final data sync via EDP followed by DNS (CNAME) redirection.

Requires an extended maintenance window (≈ 4–6 hours).

ADLS Migration: Still under evaluation (ADCopy vs ADF). Decision expected next week following renderer meeting with Madan’s team.

Environment: New clusters, workspaces, and configurations will be built in subscription 3042 (East US); only data assets migrate.

🧭 Action Items / Next Steps
#	Task	Owner	Target
1	Execute EDP POC restore benchmark (2–3 TB) to measure duration	DB Engineering + App Team	This week
2	Collect restore metrics & finalize migration playbook (including rollback plan)	ARE + DAS + DB Eng.	Next week
3	Meet itte for buy-in and confirm testing schedule	ami / soud	Next week
4	Decide ADLS migration approach (ADCopy or ADF)	Madan / Renderer / Data Ops	Next week
5	Schedule cut-over window based on POC timing	All	After POC
6	Update ORAC YAML repo and priority task sheet for Rakesh team	ARE / App Team	Ongoing
⚠️ Key Risks / Dependencies

ADLS method pending; may affect timeline.

Restore duration must be verified via POC to ensure window adequacy.

itte’s approval required for single cut-over strategy.

Next Milestone:

Complete POC and finalize ADLS method by next week.

Confirm itte’s sign-off and schedule production cut-over window.
