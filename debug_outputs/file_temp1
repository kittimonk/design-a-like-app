Subject: ECM Migration – Summary of Discussion, Finalized Decisions & Action Items

Hi All,

Below is the summary of what was discussed and finalized during the ECM migration working session (Frabola → new Azure subscription 3042), along with agreed next steps and team ownership.

🧾 Discussion Summary

The session focused on finalizing the migration approach for ECM (front-end, Azure SQL, Synapse, and ADLS).

The move is internally driven to decommission Frabola due to resource constraints and will enable deployment of ECM Version 2 in the new subscription.

The migration plan will ensure a transparent transition for itte investigators with no service disruption.

✅ Finalized Decisions

Migration Tooling:

The Enterprise Data Delivery Pipeline (EDP) will be used for both ECM SQL and Synapse SQL Pool migrations.

This replaces earlier backup/BACPAC/ADF options.

Team Responsibilities:

ARE & DAS Teams: Execute EDP pipeline for data migration and coordinate end-to-end cut-over.

DB Engineering (Jack / Jason / Sanjay / Emily): Provide technical validation, pipeline review, and restore-time benchmarks.

itte: Install ECM v2, support integration testing, and validate post-migration functionality.

Infrastructure (AR&D): Build new SQL server, clusters, and workspace configurations in subscription 3042.

Application Team (soud / ami / Bob / Pankaj): Oversee coordination, testing, and documentation updates.

Cut-Over Plan:

One-time migration and cut-over after full testing and data parity validation.

Final sync via EDP, followed by DNS (CNAME) update to redirect the front-end.

Requires an extended maintenance window (~4–6 hours).

ADLS (Data Lake) Migration:

Two options remain under evaluation – ADCopy or ADF.

Decision expected next week after Renderer/Madan meeting.

📋 Action Items & Team Ownership
#	Action Item	Owner(s)	Target
1	Run EDP POC restore (2–3 TB) to benchmark migration duration	DB Engineering + App Team	This Week
2	Gather restore metrics and update Migration Playbook / Rollback Plan	ARE + DAS + DB Engineering	Next Week
3	Conduct itte buy-in meeting and align on testing schedule	soud / ami / Bob	Next Week
4	Finalize ADLS migration approach (ADCopy vs ADF)	Renderer / Madan / Data Ops	Next Week
5	Schedule cut-over window based on POC results	ARE + App Team + Infra	After POC
6	Update ORAC YAML Repo and Priority Task Sheet	ARE / App Team	Ongoing
7	Rebuild Synapse workspace + cluster configs in new subscription	AR&D / Infra	In progress
⚠️ Key Dependencies / Risks

ADLS method not yet finalized – decision pending next week.

Cut-over requires itte’s agreement on timing and maintenance window.

Restore duration validation needed to confirm downtime assumptions.

Next Steps:

Complete EDP POC benchmark and confirm ADLS approach by next week.

Follow-up session to finalize cut-over window and sign-off with itte.
